The default reproducible run is prepared for 2 example sequences in the file \data\inputs\CAID2-test.fasta. You can put any number of sequences in the FASTA file, they will all be processed by DisorderUnetLM.

The input and output formats are based on the CAID challenge requirements (https://caid.idpcentral.org/challenge)

The resulting disorder predictions are saved in separate text files for each sequence and have the following format (index, aminoacid, disorder probability, binary disorder prediction)
